# to-do-list-practice-project
This is one of the practice projects. I've used EJS templating, MongoDB database, Express and Node.js to create server and front-end. It is one of the course projects which I took.
There has been extensive use of Mongoose library in this project in order to handle the back-end portion. So yeah, this is the project!
